        "input": "OUR PASTS \u2013 III\n62\nThe Khurda Uprising \u2013 A Case Study\nMuch before the event of 1857, there had taken place another event of a similar nature at\na place called Khurda in 1817. Here, it would be instructive for us to study that event and\nreflect on how resentment against the colonial policies of the British had been building up\nsince the beginning of the 19th century in different parts of the country.\nKhurda, a small kingdom built up in the late 16th century in the south-eastern part of\nOdisha, was a populous and well-cultivated territory consisting of 105 garhs, 60 large and\n1109 small villages at the beginning of the 19th century. Its king, Raja Birakishore Dev had\nto earlier give up the possession of four parganas, the superintendence of the Jagannath\nTemple and the administration of fourteen garjats (Princely States) to the Marathas under\ncompulsion. His son and successor, Mukunda Dev II was greatly disturbed with this loss of\nfortune. Therefore, sensing an opportunity in the Anglo-Maratha conflict, he had entered\ninto negotiations with the British to get back his lost territories and the rights over the\nJagannath Temple. But after the occupation of Odisha in 1803, the British showed no\ninclination to oblige him on either score. Consequently, in alliance with other feudatory\nchiefs of Odisha and secret support of the Marathas, he tried to assert his rights by force.\nThis led to his deposition and annexation of his territories by the British. As a matter of\nconsolation, he was only given the rights of management of the Jagannath Temple with a\ngrant amounting to a mere one-tenth of the revenue of his former estate and his residence\nwas fixed at Puri. This unfair settlement commenced an era of oppressive foreign rule in\nOdisha, which paved the way for a serious armed uprising in 1817.\nSoon after taking over Khurda, the British followed a policy of resuming service tenures.\nIt bitterly affected the lives of the ex-militia of the state, the Paiks.  The severity of the\nmeasure was compounded on account of an unreasonable increase in the demand of revenue\nand also the oppressive ways of its collection.  Consequently, there was large scale desertion\nof people from Khurda between 1805 and 1817. Yet, the British went for a series of short-\nterm settlements, each time increasing the demands, not recognising either the productive\ncapacity of the land or the paying capacity of the ryots.  No leniency was shown even in case\nof natural calamities, which Odisha was frequently prone to.  Rather, lands of defaulters\nwere sold off to scheming revenue officials or speculators from Bengal.\nThe hereditary Military Commander of the deposed king, Jagabandhu Bidyadhar\nMahapatra Bhramarabar Rai or Buxi Jagabandhu as he was popularly known, was one\namong the dispossessed land-holders.  He had in effect become a beggar, and for nearly two\nyears survived on voluntary contributions from the people of Khurda before deciding to\nfight for their grievances as well as his own.   Over the years, what had added to these\ngrievances were (a) the introduction of sicca rupee (silver currency) in the region, (b) the\ninsistence on payment of revenue in the new currency, (c) an unprecedented rise in the\nprices of food-stuff and salt, which had become far-fetched following the introduction of\nsalt monopoly because of which the traditional salt makers of Odisha were deprived of\nmaking salt, and (d) the auction of local estates in Calcutta, which brought in absentee\nlandlords from Bengal to Odisha. Besides, the insensitive and corrupt police system also\nmade the situation worse for the armed uprising to take a sinister shape.\nThe uprising was set off on 29 March 1817 as the Paiks attacked the police station and\nother government establishments at Banpur killing more than a hundred men and took\naway a large amount of government money.  Soon its ripples spread in different directions\nwith Khurda becoming its epicenter.  The zamindars and ryots alike joined the Paiks with\nenthusiasm. Those who did not, were taken to task. A \u2018no-rent campaign\u2019 was also started.\nThe British tried to dislodge the Paiks from their entrenched position but failed.  On 14\n2019-200",

When the wheel\nwas turned all the\nspindles rotated.\nIndian textiles in European markets\nBy the early eighteenth century, worried by the\npopularity of Indian textiles, wool and silk makers in\nEngland began protesting against the import of Indian\ncotton textiles. In 1720, the British government enacted\na legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles\n\u2013 chintz \u2013 in England. Interestingly, this Act was known\nas the Calico Act.\nAt this time textile industries had just begun to\ndevelop in England. Unable to compete with Indian\ntextiles, English producers wanted a secure market\nwithin the country by preventing the entry of Indian\ntextiles. The first to grow under government protection\nwas the calico printing industry. Indian designs were\nnow imitated and printed in England on white muslin\nor plain unbleached Indian cloth.\nCompetition with Indian textiles also led to a search\nfor technological innovation in England. In 1764, the\nspinning jenny was invented by John Kaye which\nincreased the productivity of the traditional spindles.\nThe invention of the steam engine by Richard Arkwright\nin 1786 revolutionised cotton textile weaving. Cloth could\nnow be woven in immense quantities and cheaply too.\nHowever, Indian textiles continued to dominate world\ntrade till the end of the eighteenth century. European\ntrading companies \u2013 the Dutch, the French and the\nEnglish \u2013 made enormous profits out of this flourishing\ntrade. These companies purchased cotton and silk\ntextiles in India by importing silver. But as you know\n(Chapter 2), when the English East India Company\ngained political power in Bengal, it no longer had to\nimport precious metal to buy Indian goods. Instead, they\ncollected revenues from peasants and zamindars in\nIndia, and used this revenue to buy Indian textiles.\nFig. 7 \nFig. 7 \nFig. 7 \nFig. 7 \nFig. 7 \u2013 A sea view of the Dutch\nsettlement in Cochin, seventeenth\ncentury\nAs European trade expanded,\ntrading settlements were\nestablished at various ports.\nThe Dutch settlements in Cochin\ncame up in the seventeenth\ncentury.

Forced by poverty, his father had to move\nfrom place to place looking for work. As an adolescent,\nBirsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past\nand saw the sirdars (leaders) of the community urging\nthe people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the\nMundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and\nsaid there would be a time when the ancestral right of\nthe community would be restored. They saw themselves\nas the descendants of the original settlers of the region,\nfighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people\nof the need to win back their kingdom.\nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and\nlistened to the sermons of missionaries. There too he\nheard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to\nattain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost\nrights. This would be possible if they became good\nChristians and gave up their \u201cbad practices\u201d. Later Birsa\nalso spent some time in the company of a prominent\nVaishnav preacher. He wore the sacred thread, and\nbegan to value the importance of purity and piety.\nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he\ncame in touch with in his growing-up years. His\nmovement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He\nurged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their\nvillage, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But\nwe must remember that Birsa also turned against\nmissionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as\noutside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life.\nIn 1895 Birsa urged his followers to recover their\nglorious past. He talked of  a golden age in the past \u2013 a\nsatyug (the age of truth) \u2013 when Mundas lived a good\nlife, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs,\nplanted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to\nearn their living. They did not kill their brethren and\nrelatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people\nto once again work on their land, settle down and\ncultivate their fields.\nWhat worried British officials most was the political\naim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out\nmissionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the\ngovernment and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at\nits head.

After a\nlong debate, the Constituent Assembly also\nrecommended that a certain percentage of seats\nin legislatures as well as jobs in government be\nreserved for members of the lowest castes. It had\nbeen argued by some that Untouchable or as they\nwere now known, Harijan, candidates did not have\ngood enough grades to get into the prestigious\nIndian Administrative Service. But, as one member\nof the Constituent Assembly, H.J. Khandekar,\nargued, it was the upper castes who were\nresponsible for the Harijans \u201cbeing unfit today\u201d.\nAddressing his more privileged colleagues,\nKhandekar said:\nWe were suppressed for thousands of years.\nYou engaged us in your service to serve your\nown ends and suppressed us to such an\nextent that neither our minds nor our bodies\nand nor even our hearts work, nor are we\nable to march forward.\nAlong with the former Untouchables, the\nadivasis or Scheduled Tribes were also granted\nreservation in seats and jobs. Like the Scheduled\nCastes, these Indians too had been deprived and\ndiscriminated against. The tribals had been\ndeprived of modern health care and education,\nwhile their lands and forests had been taken away\nby more powerful outsiders. The new privileges\ngranted them by the Constitution were meant to\nmake amends for this.\nThe Constituent Assembly spent many days\ndiscussing the powers of the central government\nversus those of the state governments.

This principle marks a departure from\nthe legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our\nsystem and causes a gap between the school, home and\ncommunity. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis\nof NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance\nof sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope\nthese measures will take us significantly further in the\ndirection of a child-centred system of education outlined in\nthe National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school\nprincipals and teachers will take to encourage children to\nreflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative\nactivities and questions. We must recognise that, given space,\ntime and freedom, children generate new knowledge by\nengaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of\nexamination is one of the key reasons why other resources\nand sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and\ninitiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as\nparticipants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\nknowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines\nand mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table\nis as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual\ncalendar so that the required number of teaching days are\nactually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching\nand evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\nproves for making children\u2019s life at school a happy experience,\nrather than a source of stress or boredom.

Murshid Quli Khan was followed by\nAlivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of\nBengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused\nto grant the Company concessions, demanded large\ntributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any\nright to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its\nfortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they\nclaimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal\ngovernment of huge amounts of revenue and\nundermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing\nto pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to\nhumiliate the nawab and his officials.\nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust\ndemands of the local officials were ruining the trade of\nthe Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties\nwere removed. It was also convinced that to expand\ntrade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages,\nand rebuild its forts.\nThe conflicts led to confrontations and finally\nculminated in the famous Battle of Plassey.\nThe Battle of Plassey\nWhen Alivardi Khan died in 1756, Sirajuddaulah became\nthe nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about\nhis power and keen on a puppet ruler who would\nwillingly give trade concessions and other privileges.\nSo it tried, though without success, to help one of\nSirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated\nSirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in\nthe political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification,\nand pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the\nNawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English\nfactory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials,\nlocked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and\nblockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta\nto establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there.\nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company\nofficials in Madras sent forces under the command of\nRobert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets.

Mill, in fact, suggested that\nthe British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure\nthe enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For\nIndia was not capable of progress without British help.\nIn this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces\nof progress and civilisation. The period before British rule\nwas one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today?\nIn any case, can we refer to any period of history as \u201cHindu\u201d\nor \u201cMuslim\u201d? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously\nin these periods? Why should we characterise an age only\nthrough the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to\nsuggest that the lives and practices of the others do not\nreally matter. We should also remember that even rulers in\nancient India did not all share the same faith.\nMoving away from British classification, historians have\nusually divided Indian history into \u2018ancient\u2019, \u2018medieval\u2019 and\n\u2018modern\u2019. This division too has its problems. It is a\nperiodisation that is borrowed from the West where the\nmodern period was associated with the growth of all the\nforces of modernity \u2013 science, reason, democracy, liberty and\nequality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society\nwhere these features of modern society did not exist. Can we\nuncritically accept this characterisation of the modern period\nto describe the period of our study? As you will see in this\nbook, under British rule people did not have equality, freedom\nor liberty. Nor was the period one of economic growth\nand progress.\nMany historians therefore refer to this period as \u2018colonial\u2019.\nWhat is colonial?\nIn this book you will read about the way the British came to\nconquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating\nlocal nawabs and rajas. You will see how they established\ncontrol over the economy and society, collected revenue to\nmeet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at\nlow prices, produced crops they needed for export, and\nyou will understand the changes that came about as a\nconsequence. You will also come to know about the changes\nBritish rule brought about in values and tastes, customs\nand practices.

How could revenues be fixed\npermanently at a time when the Company needed\nmore money to meet its expenses of administration\nand trade?\nIn the North Western Provinces of the Bengal\nPresidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh),\nan Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new\nsystem which came into effect in 1822. He felt that\nthe village was an important social institution in north\nIndian society and needed to be preserved. Under\nhis directions, collectors went from village to village,\ninspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording\nthe customs and rights of different groups. The\nestimated revenue of each plot within a village\nwas added up to calculate the revenue that each\nvillage (mahal) had to pay. This demand  was to be\nrevised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge\nof collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company\nwas given to the village headman, rather than the\nzamindar.

It was tried on a small scale by\nCaptain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were\ntaken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu\nSultan.

This meant that no other\ntrading group in England could\ncompete with the East India\nCompany. With this charter\nthe Company could venture\nacross the oceans, looking\nfor new lands from which it\ncould buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them\nback to Europe to sell at higher prices.

But time does not have to be always precisely\ndated in terms of a particular year or a month.\nSometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates\nto processes that happen over a period of time. People\nin India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they\ndeveloped a taste for it over time. There can be no one\nclear date for a process such as this. Similarly, we\ncannot fix one single date on which British rule was\nestablished, or the national movement started, or\nchanges took place within the economy and society. All\nthese things happened over a stretch of time. We can\nonly refer to a span of time, an approximate period over\nwhich particular changes became visible.\nWhy, then, do we continue to associate history\nwith a string of dates? This association has a reason.\nThere was a time when history was an account of\nbattles and big events. It was about rulers and their\npolicies. Historians wrote about the year a king was\ncrowned, the year he married, the year he had a child,\nthe year he fought a particular war, the year he died,\nand the year the next ruler succeeded to the throne.\nFor events such as these, specific dates can be\ndetermined, and in histories such as these, debates\nabout dates continue to be important.\nAs you have seen in the history textbooks of the past\ntwo years, historians now write about a host of other\nissues, and other questions. They look at how people\nearned their livelihood, what they produced and ate,\nhow cities developed and markets came up, how\nkingdoms were formed and new ideas spread, and how\ncultures and society changed.\nWhich dates?\nBy what criteria do we choose a set of dates as\nimportant? The dates we select, the dates around which\nwe compose our story of the past, are not important on\ntheir own. They become vital because we focus on a\nparticular set of events as important. If our focus of\nstudy changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a new\nset of dates will appear significant.\nConsider an example. In the histories written by\nBritish historians in India, the rule of each Governor-\nGeneral was important. These histories began with the\nrule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings,\nand ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In\nseparate chapters we read about the deeds of others \u2013\nFig. 2 \u2013 Advertisements help create\ntaste\nOld advertisements help us\nunderstand how markets for new\nproducts were created and new\ntastes were popularised.

They were asked to collect rent from\nthe peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The\namount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it\nwas not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that\nthis would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the\nCompany\u2019s coffers and at the same time encourage\nthe zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since\nthe revenue demand of the state would not be\nincreased, the zamindar would benefit from increased\nproduction from the land.\nThe problem\nThe Permanent Settlement, however, created problems.\nCompany officials soon discovered that the zamindars\nwere in fact not investing in the improvement of land.\nThe revenue that had been fixed was so high that the\nzamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to\npay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris\nwere sold off at auctions organised by the Company.\nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century the\nsituation changed. The prices in the market rose and\ncultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in\nthe income of the zamindars but no gain for the\nCompany since it could not increase a revenue demand\nthat had been fixed permanently\nEven then the zamindars did not have an interest in\nimproving the land. Some had lost their lands in the\nearlier years of the settlement; others now saw the\npossibility of earning without the trouble and risk of\ninvestment. As long as the zamindars could give out the\nland to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in\nimproving the land.\nFig. 3 \u2013 Charles Cornwallis\nCornwallis was the Governor-\nGeneral of India when the\nPermanent Settlement was\nintroduced.\nColebrook on\nBengal ryots\nIn many villages of\nBengal, some of the\npowerful ryots did not\ncultivate, but instead\ngave out their lands to\nothers (the under-tenants),\ntaking from them very\nhigh rents. In 1806, H. T.\nColebrook described the\nconditions of these under-\ntenants in Bengal:\nThe under-tenants,\ndepressed \nby \nan\nexcessive rent in kind,\nand by usurious returns\nfor the cattle, seed, and\nsubsistence, advanced\nto them, can never\nextricate themselves\nfrom debt. In so abject\na state, they cannot\nlabour in spirit, while\nthey earn a scanty\nsubsistence without\nhope of bettering their\nsituation.\nActivity\n\u0086\nWhy do you think Colebrook is concerned with the\nconditions of the under-ryots in Bengal?

It critically drew upon the ideals of religions \u2013 especially of\nHinduism and Christianity \u2013 looking at their negative and\npositive dimensions.\nDerozio and Young Bengal\nHenry Louis Vivian Derozio, a teacher at Hindu College, Calcutta, in the\n1820s, promoted radical ideas and encouraged his pupils to question all\nauthority. Referred to as the Young Bengal Movement, his students attacked\ntradition  and custom, demanded education for women and campaigned for\nthe freedom of thought and expression.\nThe Ramakrishna Mission and Swami Vivekananda\nNamed after Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Swami Vivekananda\u2019s guru, the\nRamakrishna Mission stressed the ideal of salvation through social service\nand selfless action.\nSwami Vivekananda (1863-1902), whose original name was Narendra\nNath Dutta, combined the simple teachings of Sri Ramakrishna with his\nwell founded modern outlook and spread them all over the world.  After\nhearing him in the World Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893, the\nNew York Herald reported, \u201cWe feel how foolish it is to send missionaries\nto this learned nation\u201d.  Indeed, Swami Vivekananda was the first Indian in\nmodern times, who re-established the spiritual pre-eminence of the Vedanta\nphilosophy on a global scale.  But his mission was not simply to talk of\nreligion.  He was extremely pained at the poverty and the misery of his\ncountry men.  He firmly believed that any reform could become successful only by uplifting the\ncondition of the masses.  Therefore, his clarion call to the people of India was to rise above the\nnarrow confines of their \u2018religion of the kitchen\u2019 and come together in the service of the nation.\nBy sending out this call he made a signal contribution to the nascent nationalism of India.  His\nsense of nationalism was, however, not narrow in its conception.  He was convinced that many\nof the problems facing the mankind could only be overcome if the nations of the world come\ntogether on an equal footing. Therefore, his exhortation to the youth was to unite on the basis\nof a common spiritual heritage.  In this exhortation he became truly \u2018the symbol of a new spirit\nand a source of strength for the future\u2019.\nThe Prarthana Samaj\nEstablished in 1867 at Bombay, the Prarthana Samaj sought to remove caste restrictions, abolish\nchild marriage, encourage the education of women, and end  the ban on widow remarriage.

The colonial state in India, keen to expand the market for\nBritish goods, was unwilling to support Indian industrialists. In Japan, the state\nencouraged the growth of industries.\nThe Meiji regime, which assumed power in Japan in 1868, believed that Japan\nneeded to industrialise in order to resist Western domination. So it initiated a series\nof measures to help industrialisation. Postal services, telegraph, railways, steam\npowered shipping were developed. The most advanced technology from the West\nwas imported and adapted to the needs of Japan. Foreign experts were brought to\ntrain Japanese professionals. Industrialists were provided with generous loans for\ninvestment by banks set up the government. Large industries were first started by\nthe government and then sold off at cheap rates to business families.\nIn India colonial domination created barriers to industrialisation.

Many\nmembers believed that the English language should\nleave India with the British rulers. Its place, they\nargued, should be taken by Hindi. However, those who\ndid not speak Hindi were of a different opinion. Speaking\nin the Assembly, T.T. Krishnamachari conveyed \u201ca\nwarning on behalf of people of the South\u201d, some of whom\nthreatened to separate from India if Hindi was imposed\non them. A compromise was finally arrived at: namely,\nthat while Hindi would be the \u201cofficial language\u201d of India,\nEnglish would be used in the courts, the services, and\ncommunications between one state and another.\nMany Indians contributed to the framing of the\nConstitution. But perhaps the most important role was\nplayed by Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who was Chairman of\nthe Drafting Committee, and under whose supervision\nthe document was finalised. In his final speech to the\nConstituent Assembly, Dr Ambedkar pointed out that\npolitical democracy had to be accompanied by economic\nand social democracy.

Child labour being widely\nprevalent, poor children could not be sent to school for their earning was critical for the\nsurvival of the family. The number of schools was also limited to those run by the Church\nor set up by wealthy individuals. It was only after the coming into force of the Education\nAct that schools were opened by the government and compulsory schooling was introduced.\nOne of the most important educational thinkers of the period was Thomas Arnold,\nwho became the headmaster of the private school Rugby. Favouring a secondary school\ncurriculum which had a detailed study of the Greek and Roman classics, written 2,000\nyears earlier, he said:\nIt has always seemed to me one of the great advantages of the course of study\ngenerally pursued in our English schools that it draws our minds so continually\nto dwell upon the past. Every day we are engaged in studying the languages, the\nhistory, and the thoughts of men who lived nearly or more than two thousand\nyears ago\u2026\nArnold felt that a study of the classics disciplined the mind. In fact, most educators of the\ntime believed that such a discipline was necessary because young people were naturally\nsavage and needed to be controlled. To become civilised adults, they needed to understand\nsociety\u2019s notions of right and wrong, proper and improper behaviour. Education, especially\none which disciplined their minds, was meant to guide them on this path.\nCan you suggest how such ideas might have influenced thinking about education of the\npoor in England and of the \u201cnatives\u201d in the colonies?\n2019-200",

In 1930,\nGandhiji declared that he would lead a\nmarch to break the salt law. According\nto this law, the state had a monopoly\non the manufacture and sale of salt.\nMahatma Gandhi along with other\nnationalists reasoned that it was sinful\nto tax salt since it is such an essential\nitem of our food. The Salt March related\nthe general desire of freedom to a specific\ngrievance shared by everybody, and thus\ndid not divide the rich and the poor.\nGandhiji and his followers marched\nfor over 240 miles from Sabarmati to\nthe coastal town of Dandi where they\nbroke the government law by gathering\nnatural salt found on the seashore,\nand boiling sea water to produce salt.\nWomen in the freedom struggle: Ambabai from Karnataka\nWomen from diverse backgrounds participated in the national movement. Young\nand old, single and married, they came from rural and urban areas, from both\nconservative and liberal homes. Their involvement was significant for the freedom\nstruggle, for the women\u2019s movement, and for themselves personally.\nBoth British officials and Indian nationalists felt that women\u2019s participation gave\nthe national struggle an immense force. Participation in the freedom movement\nbrought  women out of their homes. It gave them a place in the professions, in the\ngovernance of India, and it could pave the way for equality with men.\nWhat such participation meant for women is best recounted by them. Ambabai\nof Karnataka had been married at age twelve. Widowed at sixteen, she picketed\nforeign  cloth and liquor shops in Udipi. She was arrested, served a sentence and\nwas rearrested. Between prison terms she made speeches, taught spinning, and\norganised prabhat pheris.  Ambabai regarded these as the happiest days of her life\nbecause they gave it a new purpose and commitment.\n Women, however, had to fight  for their right to participate in the movement.\nDuring the Salt Satyagraha, for instance, even Mahatma Gandhi was initially opposed\nto women\u2019s participation.

He writes:\nIn Chait women went to clearings to ... cut stalks that were already reaped;\nmen cut large trees and go for their ritual hunt. The hunt began at full moon\nfrom the east. Traps of bamboo were used for hunting. The women gathered\nfruits like sago, tamarind and mushroom. Baiga women can only gather roots\nor kanda and mahua seeds. Of all the adivasis in  Central India, the Baigas\nwere known as the best hunters \u2026 In Baisakh the firing of the forest took\nplace, the women gathered unburnt wood to burn. Men continued to hunt,\nbut nearer their villages. In Jeth sowing took place and hunting still went on.\nFrom Asadh to Bhadon the men worked in the fields. In Kuar the first fruits of\nbeans were ripened and in Kartik kutki became ripe. In Aghan every crop was\nready and in Pus winnowing took place.\nPus was also the time for dances and\nmarriages. In Magh shifts were made to\nnew bewars and hunting-gathering was\nthe main subsistence activity.\nThe cycle described above took place\nin the first year. In the second year there\nwas more time for hunting as only a few\ncrops had to be sown and harvested. But\nsince there was enough food the men\nlived in the bewars.

In the hot month of April, Charles Weld,\nan American geologist and Dorabji Tata, the eldest son of\nJamsetji Tata, were travelling in Chhattisgarh in search of\niron ore deposits. They had spent many months on a costly\nventure looking for sources of good iron ore to set up a\nmodern iron and steel plant in India. Jamsetji Tata had\ndecided to spend a large part of his fortune to build a big\niron and steel industry in India. But this could not be done\nwithout identifying the source of fine quality iron ore.\nOne day, after travelling for many hours in the forests,\nWeld and Dorabji came upon a small village and found a\ngroup of men and women carrying basketloads of iron ore.\nThese people were the Agarias. When asked where they had\nfound the iron ore, the Agarias pointed to a hill in the\ndistance. Weld and Dorabji reached the hill after an\nexhausting trek through dense forests. On exploring the hill\nthe geologist declared that they had at last found what they\nhad been looking for. Rajhara Hills had one of the finest ores\nin the world.\nBut there was a problem. The region was dry and water \u2013\nnecessary for running the factory \u2013 was not to be found\nnearby. The Tatas had to continue their search for a more\nsuitable place to set up their factory. However, the Agarias\nhelped in the discovery of a source of iron ore that would\nlater supply the Bhilai Steel Plant.\nA few years later a large area of forest was cleared on the\nbanks of the river Subarnarekha to set up the factory and\nan industrial township \u2013 Jamshedpur.

The first mill in\nAhmedabad was started in 1861. A year later a mill\nwas established in Kanpur, in the United Provinces.\nGrowth of cotton mills led to a demand for labour.\nThousands of poor peasants, artisans and agricultural\nlabourers moved to the cities to work in the mills.\nIn the first few decades of its existence, the textile\nfactory industry in India faced many problems. It found\nit difficult to compete with the cheap textiles imported\nfrom Britain. In most countries, governments supported\nindustrialisation by imposing heavy duties on imports.\nThis eliminated competition and protected infant\nindustries. The colonial government in India usually\nrefused such protection to local industries. The first\nmajor spurt in the development of cotton factory\nproduction in India, therefore, was during the First\nWorld War when textile imports from Britain declined\nand Indian factories were called upon to produce cloth\nfor military supplies.\nThe sword of Tipu Sultan and\nWootz steel\nWe begin the story of Indian steel and iron metallurgy\nby recounting the famous story of Tipu Sultan who ruled\nMysore till 1799, fought four wars with the British\nand died fighting with his sword in his hand. Tipu\u2019s\nlegendary swords are now part of valuable collections\nin museums in England. But do you know why the sword\nwas so special? The sword had an incredibly hard and\nsharp edge that could easily rip through the opponent\u2019s\narmour. This quality of the sword came from a special\ntype of high carbon steel called Wootz which was\nproduced all over south India. Wootz steel when made\ninto swords produced a very sharp edge with a flowing\nwater pattern. This pattern came from very small carbon\ncrystals embedded in the iron.\nFrancis Buchanan who toured through Mysore in\n1800, a year after Tipu Sultan\u2019s death, has left us an\naccount of the technique by which Wootz steel was\nproduced in many hundreds of smelting furnaces in\nMysore. In these furnaces, iron was mixed with charcoal\nand put inside small clay pots. Through an intricate\ncontrol of temperatures the smelters produced steel\ningots that were used for sword making not just in India\nbut in West and Central Asia too.

And the country, its resources and systems,\nwere meant for all of them. With this answer came the\nawareness that the British were exercising control over\nthe resources of India and the lives of its people, and\nuntil this control was ended India could not be for Indians.\nThis consciousness began to be clearly stated by the\npolitical associations formed after 1850, especially those\nthat came into being in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of\nthese were led by English-educated professionals such\nas lawyers.

Though many of these\nassociations functioned in specific parts of the country,\ntheir goals were stated as the goals of all the people\nof India, not those of any one region, community or\nclass. They worked with the idea that the people should\nbe sovereign \u2013 a modern consciousness and a key\nfeature of nationalism. In other words, they believed\nthat the Indian people should be empowered to take\ndecisions regarding their affairs.\nThe dissatisfaction with British rule intensified in\nthe 1870s and 1880s. The Arms Act was passed in 1878,\ndisallowing Indians from possessing arms. In the\nsame year the Vernacular Press Act was also enacted\nin an effort to silence those who were critical of the\ngovernment. The Act allowed the government to\nconfiscate the assets of newspapers including their\nprinting presses if the newspapers published anything\nthat was found \u201cobjectionable\u201d. In 1883, there was a\nfurore over the attempt by the government to introduce\nthe Ilbert Bill. The bill provided for the trial of British\nor European persons by Indians, and sought equality\nbetween British and Indian judges in the country. But\nwhen white opposition forced the government to\nwithdraw the bill, Indians were enraged.

Being an alien power, it needed\nto pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside,\nand enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held\nlocal power had to be controlled but they could not be\nentirely eliminated.\nHow was this to be done? In this chapter we will see\nhow the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise\nrevenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce\nthe crops it wanted.\nRevenue for the Company\nThe Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself\nprimarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but\nwas unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment\nand collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much\nas it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as\npossible. Within five years the value of goods bought by the\nCompany in Bengal doubled. Before 1865, the Company had\npurchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from\nBritain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance\nthe purchase of goods for export.\nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing\na deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they\nwere being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low\nprices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being\ndemanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline,\nand agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse.

Do you know how this colour was produced?\nThe blue that you see in these prints was produced\nfrom a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye\nused in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century Britain\nwas manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India.\nFor India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world\nat that time.\nWhy the demand for Indian indigo?\nThe indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the\nthirteenth century Indian indigo was being used by cloth\nmanufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth.\nHowever, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached\nthe European market and its price was very high.\nEuropean cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend\non another plant called woad to make violet and blue\ndyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was\nmore easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern\nItaly, southern France and in parts of Germany and\nBritain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad\nproducers in Europe pressurised their governments to\nban the import of indigo.\nCloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye. Indigo\nproduced a rich blue colour, whereas the dye from woad\nwas pale and dull. By the seventeenth century, European\ncloth producers persuaded their governments to relax\nthe ban on indigo import. The French began cultivating\nindigo in St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the\nPortuguese in Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the\nSpanish in Venezuela. Indigo plantations also came up\nin many parts of North America.\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for\nIndian indigo grew further. Britain began to industrialise,\nand its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating\nan enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the\ndemand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from\nthe West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of\nreasons. Between 1783 and 1789 the production of\nindigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain\nnow desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply.\nFrom where could this indigo be procured?\nBritain turns to India\nFaced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the\nCompany in India looked for ways to expand the area\nunder indigo cultivation.\nPlantation \u2013 A\nlarge farm operated\nby a planter\nemploying various\nforms of forced\nlabour.

The\npriests of the Jagannath Temple also extended the Paiks their full support.\nSeeing the situation going out of hand, the British clamped Martial Law. The King was\nquickly captured and sent to prison in Cuttack with his son.  The Buxi with his close associate,\nKrushna Chandra Bhramarabar Rai, tried to cut off all communications between Cuttack\nand Khurda as the uprising spread to the southern and the north-western parts of Odisha.\nConsequently, the British sent Major-General Martindell to clear off the area from the\nclutches of the Paiks while at the same time announcing rewards for the arrest of Buxi\njagabandhu and his associates.  In the ensuing operation hundreds of Paiks were killed,\nmany fled to deep jungles and some returned home under a scheme of amnesty.  Thus by\nMay 1817 the uprising was mostly contained.\nHowever, outside Khurda it was sustained by Buxi Jagabandhu with the help of supporters\nlike the Raja of Kujung and the unflinching loyalty of the Paiks until his surrender in May\n1825.  On their part, the British henceforth adopted a policy of \u2018leniency, indulgence and\nforbearance\u2019 towards the people of Khurda.

These chiefs were held\ntogether in a confederacy under a Peshwa (Principal\nMinister) who became its effective military and\nadministrative head based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia\nand Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers\nand statesmen of the late eighteenth century.\nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. In\nthe first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of\nSalbai, there was no clear victor.

Finally, the Third Anglo-Maratha War of\n1817-19 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was\nremoved and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a\npension. The Company now had complete control over\nthe territories south of the Vindhyas.\nThe claim to paramountcy\nIt is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth\ncentury the Company pursued an aggressive policy of\nterritorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings (Governor-\nGeneral from 1813 to 1823) a new policy of \u201cparamountcy\u201d\nwas initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority\nwas paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater\nthan that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests\nit was justified in annexing or threatening to annex\nany Indian kingdom. This view continued to guide later\nBritish policies as well.\nThis process, however, did not go unchallenged. For\nexample, when the British tried to annex the small state\nof Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took\nto arms and led an anti-British resistance movement.\nShe was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829.\nBut Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor,\ncarried on the resistance.

The citizens of this vast land spoke many\ndifferent languages, wore many different kinds of dress,\nate different kinds of food and practised different\nprofessions. How could they be made to live together in\none nation-state?\nTo the problem of unity was added the problem of\ndevelopment. At Independence, the vast majority of\nIndians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants\ndepended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the\nnon-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops\nfailed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service\ngroups would not get paid for their services either. In\nthe cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums with\nlittle access to education or health care. Clearly, the\nnew nation had to lift its masses out of poverty by\nincreasing the productivity of agriculture and by\npromoting new, job-creating industries.\nUnity and development had to go hand in hand. If\nthe divisions between different sections of India were\nnot healed, they could result in violent and costly\nconflicts \u2013 high castes fighting with low castes, Hindus\nwith Muslims and so on. At the same time, if the fruits\nof economic development did not reach the broad masses\nof the population, it could create fresh divisions \u2013 for\nexample, between the rich and the poor, between cities\nand the countryside, between regions of India that were\nprosperous and regions that lagged behind.\nA Constitution is Written\nBetween December 1946 and November 1949, some\nthree hundred Indians had a series of meetings on\nthe country\u2019s political future. The meetings of this\n\u201cConstituent Assembly\u201d were held in New Delhi, but\nthe participants came from all over India, and from\ndifferent political parties. These discussions resulted\nin the framing of the Indian Constitution, which came\ninto effect on 26 January 1950.\nOne feature of the Constitution was its adoption of\nuniversal adult franchise. All Indians above the age of\n21 would be allowed to vote in state and national\nelections. This was a revolutionary step \u2013 for never before\nhad Indians been allowed to choose their own leaders.\nIn other countries, such as the United Kingdom and\nINDIA AFTER INDEPENDENCE\n2019-200",

So it allowed\nthe local pathshalas to function without much\ninterference. After 1854 the Company decided to\nimprove the system of vernacular education. It felt that\nthis could be done by introducing order within the\nsystem, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring\nregular inspections.\nHow was this to be done? What measures did\nthe Company undertake? It appointed a number of\ngovernment pandits, each in charge of looking after four\nto five schools. The task of the pandit was to visit the\npathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching.\nEach guru was asked to submit periodic reports and\ntake classes according to a regular timetable. Teaching\nwas now to be based on textbooks and learning was\nto be tested through a system of annual examination.\nStudents were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular\nclasses, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules\nof discipline.\nPathshalas which accepted the new rules were\nsupported through government grants. Those who were\nunwilling to work within the new system received no\ngovernment support. Over time gurus who wanted to\nretain their independence found it difficult to compete\nwith the government aided and regulated pathshalas.\nThe new rules and routines had another consequence.\nIn the earlier system children from poor peasant families\nhad been able to go to pathshalas, since the timetable\nwas flexible. The discipline of the new system demanded\nregular attendance, even during harvest time when\nchildren of poor families had to work in the fields.\nInability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline,\nas evidence of the lack of desire to learn.\nThe Agenda for a National Education\nBritish officials were not the only people thinking about\neducation in India. From the early nineteenth century\nmany thinkers from different parts of India began\nto talk of the need for a wider spread of education.\nImpressed with the developments in Europe, some\nIndians felt that Western education would help modernise\nIndia. They urged the British to open more schools,\ncolleges and universities, and spend more money on\neducation. You will read about some of these efforts in\nActivity\n1. Imagine you were born\nin a poor family in the\n1850s. How would you\nhave responded to the\ncoming of the new\nsystem of  government-\nregulated pathshalas?\n2.

Can you think of\nthe various possible\nreasons for this fact?\n\u0086\nIn a speech delivered on\nJanuary 15, 1908 in Bombay,\nAurobindo Ghose stated that\nthe goal of national education\nwas to awaken the spirit of\nnationality among the\nstudents.  This required a\ncontemplation of the heroic\ndeeds of our ancestors.  The\neducation should be imparted\nin the vernacular so as to\nreach the largest number of\npeople.  Aurobindo Ghose\nemphasised that although the\nstudents should remain\nconnected to their own roots,\nthey should also take the\nfullest advantage of modern\nscientific discoveries and\nWestern experiments in\npopular governments.\nMoreover, the students should\nalso learn some useful crafts so\nthat they could be able to find\nsome moderately remunerative\nemployment after leaving their\nschools.\nFig. 9\nFig. 9\nFig. 9\nFig. 9\nFig. 9 \u2013 Sri Aurobindo Ghose\n2019-200",

So changes in forest laws had\na considerable effect on tribal lives. The British extended\ntheir control over all forests and declared that forests\nwere state property. Some forests were classified as\nReserved Forests for they produced timber which the\nBritish wanted. In these forests people were not allowed\nto move freely, practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits,\nor hunt animals. How were jhum cultivators to survive\nin such a situation? Many were therefore forced to move\nto other areas in search of work and livelihood.\nBut once the British stopped the tribal people from\nliving inside forests, they faced a problem. From where\nwould the Forest Department get its labour to cut trees\nfor railway sleepers and to transport logs?\nColonial officials came up with a solution. They\ndecided that they would give jhum cultivators small\npatches of land in the forests and allow them to cultivate\nthese on the condition that those who lived in the\nvillages would have to provide labour to the Forest\nDepartment and look after the forests.
