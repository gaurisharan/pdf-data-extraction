To fight for swaraj, the radicals advocated\nmass mobilisation and boycott of British institutions\nand goods. Some individuals also began to suggest\nthat \u201crevolutionary violence\u201d would be necessary to\noverthrow British rule.\nThe opening decades of the twentieth century were\nmarked by other developments as well. A group of Muslim\nlandlords and nawabs formed the All India Muslim\nLeague at Dacca in 1906. The League supported the\npartition of Bengal. It desired separate electorates for\nMuslims, a demand conceded by the government in\n1909. Some seats in the councils were now reserved\nfor Muslims who would be elected by Muslim voters.\nThis tempted politicians to gather a following by\ndistributing favours to their own religious groups.\n Meanwhile, the Congress split in 1907. The Moderates\nwere opposed to the use of boycott. They felt that it\ninvolved the use of force. After the split the Congress\ncame to be dominated by the Moderates with Tilak\u2019s\nfollowers functioning from outside. The two groups\nreunited in December 1915. Next year the Congress\nand the Muslim League signed the historic Lucknow\nPact and decided to work together for representative\ngovernment in the country.\nThe Growth of Mass Nationalism\nAfter 1919 the struggle against British rule gradually\nbecame a mass movement, involving peasants, tribals,\nstudents and women in large numbers and occasionally\nfactory workers as well. Certain business groups too\nbegan to actively support the Congress in the 1920s.\nWhy was this so?\nThe First World War altered the economic and\npolitical situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the\ndefence expenditure of the Government of India. The\ngovernment in turn increased taxes on individual\nincomes and business profits. Increased military\nexpenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a\nsharp rise in prices which created great difficulties\nfor the common people. On the other hand, business\ngroups reaped fabulous profits from the war.

Together with\nthem, Jones set up the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and\nstarted a journal called Asiatick Researches.\nJones and Colebrooke came to represent a particular\nattitude towards India. They shared a deep respect for\nancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian\ncivilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the ancient\npast, but had subsequently declined. In order to\nunderstand India it was necessary to discover the sacred\nand legal texts that were produced in the ancient period.\nFor only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws\nof the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of these\ntexts could form the basis of future development in India.\nSo Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering\nancient texts, understanding their meaning, translating\nthem, and making their findings known to others. This\nproject, they believed, would not only help the British learn\nfrom Indian culture, but it would also help Indians\nrediscover their own heritage, and understand the lost\nglories of their past. In this process the British would become\nthe guardians of Indian culture as well as its masters.\nInfluenced by such ideas, many Company officials\nargued that the British ought to promote Indian rather\nthan Western learning. They felt that institutions should\nbe set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts\nand teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry.\nThe officials also thought that Hindus and Muslims\nought to be taught what they were already familiar with,\nand what they valued and treasured, not subjects that\nwere alien to them.

The price they got for the indigo they produced\nwas very low and the cycle of loans never ended.\nThere were other problems too. The planters usually\ninsisted that indigo be cultivated on the best soils in\nwhich peasants preferred to cultivate rice. Indigo,\nmoreover, had deep roots and it exhausted the soil\nrapidly. After an indigo harvest the land could not be\nsown with rice.\nThe \u201cBlue Rebellion\u201d and After\nIn March 1859 thousands of ryots in Bengal refused to\ngrow indigo. As the rebellion spread, ryots refused to\npay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories\narmed with swords and spears, bows and arrows.\nWomen turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen\nimplements. Those who worked for the planters were\nsocially boycotted, and the gomasthas \u2013 agents of\nplanters \u2013 who came to collect rent were beaten up.\nRyots swore they would no longer take advances to sow\nindigo nor be bullied by the planters\u2019 lathiyals \u2013 the\nlathi-wielding strongmen maintained by the planters.\nWhy did the indigo peasants decide that they would\nno longer remain silent? What gave them the power\nto rebel? Clearly, the indigo system was intensely\noppressive. But those who are oppressed do not always\nrise up in rebellion. They do so only at times.\nIn 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the\nsupport of the local zamindars and village headmen in\ntheir rebellion against the planters. In many villages,\nheadmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts,\nmobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched\nbattles with the lathiyals. In other places even the\nzamindars went around villages urging the ryots to\nresist the planters. These zamindars were unhappy with\nthe increasing power of the planters and angry at being\nforced by the planters to give them land on long leases.\nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British\ngovernment would support them in their struggle\nagainst the planters.

Brahmans and Kshatriyas considered\nthemselves as \u201cupper castes\u201d. Others, such as traders\nand moneylenders (often referred to as Vaishyas) were\nplaced after them. Then came peasants, and artisans\nsuch as weavers and potters (referred to as Shudras).\nAt the lowest rung were those who laboured to keep\ncities and villages clean or worked at jobs that upper\ncastes considered \u201cpolluting\u201d, that is, it could lead to\nthe loss of caste status. The upper castes also treated\nmany of these groups at the bottom as \u201cuntouchable\u201d.\nThey were not allowed to enter temples, draw water\nfrom the wells used by the upper castes, or bathe in\nponds where upper castes bathed. They were seen as\ninferior human beings.\nOver the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many\nof these norms and perceptions slowly changed. Let us\nsee how this happened.\nWorking Towards Change\nFrom the early nineteenth century, we find debates and\ndiscussions about social customs and practices taking on\na new character. One important reason for this was\nthe development of new forms of communication. For the\nfirst time, books, newspapers, magazines, leaflets and\npamphlets were printed. These were far cheaper and\nfar more accessible than the manuscripts that you have\nread about in Class VII. Therefore ordinary people could\nread these, and many of them could also write and\nexpress their ideas in their own languages. All kinds of\nissues \u2013 social, political, economic and religious \u2013 could\nnow be debated and discussed by men (and sometimes\nby women as well) in the new cities. The discussions\ncould reach out to a wider public, and could become\nlinked to movements for social change.\nThese debates were often initiated by Indian reformers\nand reform groups. One such reformer was Raja\nRammohun Roy (1772-1833). He founded a reform\nassociation known as the Brahmo Sabha (later known\nas the Brahmo Samaj) in Calcutta. People such as\nRammohun Roy are described as reformers because they\nfelt that changes were necessary in society, and unjust\npractices needed to be done away with. They thought\nthat the best way to ensure such changes was by\npersuading people to give up old practices and adopt a\nnew way of life.\nWOMEN, CASTE AND REFORM\nActivity\nCan you think of the\nways in which social\ncustoms and practices\nwere discussed in the\npre-printing age when\nbooks, newspapers and\npamphlets were not\nreadily available?\n\u0086\n2019-200",

They argued that\nBrahmans were heirs of Aryan invaders from the\nnorth who had conquered southern lands from\nthe original inhabitants of the region \u2013 the indigenous\nDravidian races. They also challenged Brahmanical\nclaims to power.\nE.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, or Periyar, as he\nwas called, came from a middle-class family.\nInterestingly, he had been an ascetic in his early\nlife and had studied Sanskrit scriptures carefully.\nLater, he became a member of the Congress, only to\nleave it in disgust when he found that at a feast\norganised by nationalists, seating arrangements\nfollowed caste distinctions \u2013 that is, the lower castes\nwere made to sit at a distance from the upper castes.\nConvinced that untouchables had to fight for their\ndignity, Periyar founded the Self Respect Movement.\nHe argued that untouchables were the true\nupholders of an original Tamil and Dravidian culture\nwhich had been subjugated by Brahmans. He felt\nthat all religious authorities saw social divisions\nand inequality as God-given. Untouchables had to\nfree themselves, therefore, from all religions in order\nto achieve social equality.\nPeriyar was an outspoken critic of Hindu scriptures,\nespecially the Codes of Manu, the ancient lawgiver,\nand the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana. He said\nthat these texts had been used to establish the\nauthority of Brahmans over lower castes and the\ndomination of men over women.\nThese assertions did not go unchallenged. The\nforceful speeches, writings and movements of lower-\ncaste leaders did lead to rethinking and some self-\ncriticism among upper-caste nationalist leaders. But\northodox Hindu society also reacted by founding\nSanatan Dharma Sabhas and the Bharat Dharma\nMahamandal in the north, and associations like the\nBrahman Sabha in Bengal. The object of these\nassociations was to uphold caste distinctions as a\ncornerstone of Hinduism, and show how this was\nsanctified by scriptures. Debates and struggles over\ncaste continued beyond the colonial period and are\nstill going on in our own times.\nPeriyar on women\nPeriyar wrote:\nOnly with the arrival of\nwords such as Thara\nMukurtham our women\nhad become puppets in\nthe hands of their\nhusbands \u2026 we ended\nup with such fathers\nwho \nadvise \ntheir\ndaughters ... that they\nhad been gifted away\nto their husbands and\nthey belong to their\nhusband\u2019s place.

If this could be done without\nconquest, through the help of local rulers who were\nwilling to grant privileges, then territories need not be\ntaken over directly.\nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather\ndifficult.

After all,\nthey had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and\nsovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects.\nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar\nprotested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir\nQasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in\nturn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1764),\ndriven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The\nNawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the\nCompany wanted more money to finance its wars, and\nmeet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It\nwanted more territories and more revenue. By the time\nMir Jafar died in 1765 the mood of the Company had\nchanged. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive\ndeclared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d\nFinally, in 1765 the Mughal emperor appointed the\nCompany as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The\nDiwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue\nresources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that\nthe Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth\ncentury its trade with India had expanded. But it had\nto buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver\nimported from Britain. This was because at this time\nBritain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of\ngold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey,\nand entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani.\nNow revenues from India could finance Company\nexpenses. These revenues could be used to purchase\ncotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company\ntroops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort\nand offices at Calcutta.\nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d\nWhat did it mean to be nawabs?

Indian\ntextiles had long been renowned\nboth for their fine quality and\nexquisite craftsmanship. They\nwere extensively traded in\nSoutheast Asia (Java, Sumatra\nand Penang) and West and\nCentral Asia. From the sixteenth\ncentury \nEuropean \ntrading\ncompanies began buying Indian\ntextiles for sale in Europe.\nMemories of this flourishing\ntrade and the craftsmanship of\nIndian weavers is preserved in\nmany words still current in\nEnglish and other languages. It\nis interesting to trace the origin of such words, and see\nwhat they tell us.\nWords tell us histories\nEuropean traders first encountered fine cotton cloth\nfrom India carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in\npresent-day Iraq. So they began referring to all finely\nwoven textiles as \u201cmuslin\u201d \u2013 a word that acquired wide\ncurrency. When the Portuguese first came to India in\nsearch of spices they landed in Calicut on the Kerala\ncoast in south-west India. The cotton textiles which\nthey took back to Europe, along with the spices, came\nto be called \u201ccalico\u201d (derived from Calicut), and\nsubsequently calico became the general name for all\ncotton textiles.\nThere are many other words which point to the\npopularity of Indian textiles in Western markets. In\nFig. 3 you can see a page of an order book that the\nEnglish East India Company sent to its representatives\nin Calcutta in 1730.\nThe order that year was for 5,89,000 pieces of cloth.\nBrowsing through the order book you would have seen\na list of 98 varieties of cotton and silk cloths.
